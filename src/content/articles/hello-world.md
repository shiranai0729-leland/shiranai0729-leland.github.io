Welcome to my new personal website! 

## Why Astro?

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/) for this project because of its excellent performance and developer experience. Here are a few key reasons:

1. **Content-focused**: Astro is designed for content-rich websites like this portfolio.
2. **Zero JS by default**: It ships less JavaScript to the browser, resulting in faster load times.
3. **Flexible**: I can use React, Vue, or Svelte components if I need them.

## Tech Stack

This site is built using:

- **Astro**: The web framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting
