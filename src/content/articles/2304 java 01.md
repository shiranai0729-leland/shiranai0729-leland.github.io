# Java Learning Notes 01: Introduction

## 1. Introduction

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers *write once, run anywhere* (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

### 1.1 Java Editions

Java is distributed in three main editions, each targeting different types of applications:

- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**: This is the core Java platform. It includes the Java Class Library and is used to develop desktop and server-side applications. It provides the foundation for the other editions.
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**: Built on top of Java SE, this edition is used for developing large-scale, distributed, commercial, and enterprise-level applications. It includes libraries for database access (JPA), web services (JAX-RS), and more. *Note: It has been rebranded as Jakarta EE.*
- **Java ME (Micro Edition)**: Designed for embedded systems and mobile devices (like feature phones and set-top boxes). While less prominent today due to the rise of Android (which uses its own Java-like framework), it is still used in IoT devices.

### 1.2 Core Terminology

Understanding the relationship between JDK, JRE, and JVM is crucial for any Java developer.

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: A full-featured software development kit for developers. It contains the JRE plus development tools such as the compiler (`javac`), debugger, and documentation tools (`javadoc`).
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: The environment required to *run* Java applications. It consists of the JVM and the Java Class Library. It does not contain development tools.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: The engine that executes Java bytecode. It provides a platform-independent execution environment that converts Java bytecode into machine language for the specific host operating system.

**Relationship:**
> JDK = JRE + Development Tools
>
> JRE = JVM + Standard Class Libraries

### 1.3 Installing the JDK

To start developing in Java, you need to install the JDK.

1.  **Download JDK**: Visit the official Oracle website or an OpenJDK provider (like Adoptium) to download the JDK installer. JDK 8, 11, 17, and 21 are common Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.
2.  **Install**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  **Note the Install Path**: Remember where you installed Java (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).
4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    *   **JAVA_HOME**: Create a new system variable named `JAVA_HOME` and set its value to your JDK installation path. This is used by many build tools (like Maven and Gradle) and IDEs.
    *   **Path**: Edit the system `Path` variable and append `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`. This allows you to run `java` and `javac` commands from any command prompt window.
5.  **Verify Installation**: Open a command prompt (cmd) or terminal and run:
    ```bash
    java -version
    javac -version
    ```
    If you see version information output, the installation is successful.

## 2. Hello World

Let's write your first Java program.

### 2.1 Writing Code

Create a file named `Hello.java` and enter the following code:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

**Code Breakdown:**
- `public class Hello`: Defines a class named `Hello`. In Java, all code must reside inside a class.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the entry point of any Java application. The JVM looks for this specific method signature to start execution.
- `System.out.println("...")`: Prints text to the console followed by a newline.

### 2.2 Compilation and Execution

Java is a compiled language, but unlike C++, it compiles to bytecode, not machine code.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing your `Hello.java` file.
3.  **Compile**: Run the compiler to generate the bytecode file (`Hello.class`).
    ```bash
    javac Hello.java
    ```
4.  **Run**: Execute the compiled bytecode using the JVM.
    ```bash
    java Hello
    ```
    *Note: Do not add the `.class` extension when running the program.*

### 2.3 Important Notes

1.  **Case Sensitivity**: Java is case-sensitive. `Hello` and `hello` are different identifiers.
2.  **File Naming**: The public class name **must** match the filename exactly. If your class is `public class Hello`, the file must be named `Hello.java`.
3.  **Syntax**: Statements typically end with a semicolon `;`. Blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

### 2.4 Troubleshooting

If you encounter "command not found" or version mismatch errors:

1.  **Check Path**: Ensure your `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` is correctly added to your system `Path`.
2.  **Check for Conflicts**: Run `where java` (on Windows) or `which java` (on Linux/macOS) to see which Java executable is being used.
    *   If you see multiple paths, ensure your desired JDK path appears *before* others (like `C:\Windows\System32`).
    *   Remove or update conflicting paths in your environment variables.
3.  **Recompile**: If you switch JDK versions, always recompile your `.java` files to ensure the `.class` files are compatible.

## 3. Java Execution Mechanism

Programming languages are generally categorized as either **Compiled** or **Interpreted**.

- **Compiled Languages** (e.g., C, C++): Source code is compiled directly into machine code for a specific architecture.
    *   *Pros*: High execution efficiency.
    *   *Cons*: Platform dependent; requires recompilation for different OSs.
- **Interpreted Languages** (e.g., Python, JavaScript): Source code is read and executed line-by-line by an interpreter.
    *   *Pros*: Cross-platform; easy to debug.
    *   *Cons*: Slower execution speed.

**Java's Approach**:
Java uses a hybrid approach.
1.  **Compilation**: `javac` compiles source code (`.java`) into **Bytecode** (`.class`). Bytecode is an intermediate set of instructions that is platform-independent.
2.  **Interpretation/JIT**: The JVM loads the bytecode. It can interpret it line-by-line or use the **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler** to compile hot (frequently used) code blocks into native machine code at runtime for higher performance.

This architecture gives Java its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability while maintaining near-native performance.
