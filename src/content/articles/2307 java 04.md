# Java Learning Notes 04: Basics of Java Methods

## 1.1 What is a Method?

1.  A method is a collection of statements that together perform a specific function.
2.  Methods are an ordered sequence of steps for solving a specific class of problems.
3.  Methods are contained within classes or objects.
4.  Methods are created in a program and referenced elsewhere.
5.  **Principle of Method Design**: The primary purpose of a method is to act as a functional block—a collection of statements that implement a particular functionality. When designing methods, it is best to maintain **atomicity**: a single method should perform only one function. This facilitates future extensions and maintenance.

**Example Code for Methods:**

```java
package JavaFUN;

public class Demo01 {
    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = add(30, 40);
        System.out.println(sum);
    }

    // Addition method
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

A Java method is similar to a function in other languages—a code snippet used to complete a specific task. Generally, defining a method involves the following syntax:

*A method consists of a method header and a method body. Below are all the components of a method:*

1.  **Modifiers**: These are optional. They tell the compiler how to call the method and define its access type.
2.  **Return Value Type**: A method may return a value. `returnValueType` is the data type of the value the method returns. Some methods perform required operations without returning a value; in this case, `returnValueType` is the keyword `void`.
3.  **Method Name**: This is the actual name of the method. Together, the method name and the parameter list constitute the **method signature**.
4.  **Parameter Type**: A parameter acts like a placeholder. When a method is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as an actual parameter (argument) or variable. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of parameters. Parameters are optional; a method may contain no parameters.
5.  **Formal Parameters**: Used to receive external input data when the method is called.
6.  **Actual Parameters (Arguments)**: The actual data passed to the method when it is invoked.
7.  **Method Body**: Contains specific statements that define the functionality of the method.

```java
modifier returnValueType methodName(parameterType parameterName) {
    // ...
    // Method body
    // ...
    return value;
}
```

## 1.2 Method Overloading

Overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different formal parameters.

**Rules for Method Overloading:**

-   The method name must be the same.
-   The parameter list must be different (different number of parameters, different types, or different order).
-   The return type does not matter.
-   Simply having different return types is not enough to constitute method overloading.

**Implementation Theory**: When multiple methods have the same name, the compiler selects the appropriate one by matching the number and type of parameters passed in the method call. If no match is found, the compiler throws an error.

**Example Code:**

```java
package JavaFUN;

public class Demo01 {
    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum1 = add(30, 40);
        int sum2 = add(30, 40, 50);
        System.out.println(sum1);
        System.out.println(sum2);
    }

    // Addition method (Overloaded)
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```

# 2 Command-Line Arguments

Sometimes you may want to pass information to a program while it is running. This is achieved by passing command-line arguments to the `main()` function.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(args[i]);
    }
}
```

# 3 Variable Arguments (Varargs)

-   Starting from JDK 1.5, Java supports passing a variable number of arguments of the same type to a method.
-   In the method declaration, add an ellipsis (`...`) after the specified parameter type.
-   Only one variable argument can be specified per method, and it **must be the last parameter**. Any ordinary parameters must be declared before it.

**Example Code:**

```java
public static void printMax(double... numbers) {
    if (numbers.length == 0) {
        System.out.println("No arguments passed");
        return;
    }
    double result = numbers[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] > result) {
            result = numbers[i];
        }
    }
    System.out.println("The max value is " + result);
}
```

# 4 Recursion

While it is easy to understand Method A calling Method B, recursion is the process of Method A calling itself.

Recursion can be used to solve complex problems with simple programs. It typically decomposes a large, complex problem into smaller sub-problems similar to the original. A recursive strategy requires only a small amount of code to describe the multiple repeated calculations needed for the solution, significantly reducing the amount of code. The power of recursion lies in using finite statements to define an infinite set of objects.

**A recursive structure consists of two parts:**

-   **Base Case (Recursive Head)**: Defines when the method should stop calling itself. Without a base case, the program will fall into an infinite loop (and eventually a `StackOverflowError`).
-   **Recursive Case (Recursive Body)**: Defines when the method needs to call itself to proceed with the calculation.
