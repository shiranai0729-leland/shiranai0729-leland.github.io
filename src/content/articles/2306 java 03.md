# Java Learning Notes 03: Flow Control

# 1 User Interaction: Scanner

*Java provides a utility class to obtain user input. `java.util.Scanner` is a feature introduced in Java 5, allowing us to capture user input via the `Scanner` class.*

## 1.1 Basic Syntax of Scanner

- Basic Syntax:

```java
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
```

We can retrieve input strings using the `next()` and `nextLine()` methods of the `Scanner` class. Before reading, it is generally recommended to use `hasNext()` and `hasNextLine()` to check if there is input data available.

- Example Code:

```java
// Demo01 Scanner demo
package JavaLCKZ;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Demo01 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Using next to receive:");

        // Check if the user has input a string
        if (scanner.hasNext()){
            // Receive user input
            String str = scanner.next(); // Program waits for user input
            System.out.println("Input content is: " + str);
        }

        // IO streams should be closed promptly to prevent resource occupation
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

- `next()`:
    - Must read valid characters before ending the input.
    - Automatically removes whitespace encountered before the valid characters.
    - Only considers whitespace as a delimiter or terminator after valid characters have been input.
    - `next()` cannot obtain strings containing spaces.
- `nextLine()`:
    - Uses 'Enter' as the terminator, meaning `nextLine()` returns all characters input before the carriage return.
    - Can capture whitespace.

## 1.2 Advanced Scanner Usage

- Using Scanner to judge input data types:

```java
package JavaLCKZ;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Demo02 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = 0;
        System.out.println("Please enter an integer:");
        if (scanner.hasNextInt()){
            i = scanner.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Integer data: " + i);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Input is not integer data!");
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

# 2 Selection Structures

## 2.1 `if` Single-Selection Structure

- Syntax:

```java
if(boolean) {
    // TODO;
}
```

- Example:

```java
String s = scanner.nextLine();
if(s.equals("Hello")){
    System.out.println(s);
}
```

## 2.2 `if` Double-Selection Structure

- Syntax:

```java
if(boolean) {
    // TODO;
} else {
    // TODO;
}
```

## 2.3 `if` Multi-Selection Structure

- Syntax:

```java
if(boolean) {
    // TODO;
} else if(boolean) {
    // TODO;
} else if(boolean) {
    // TODO;
} else {
    // TODO;
}
```

## 2.4 `switch` Multi-Selection Structure

- Syntax:

```java
switch(expression){
    case value1:
        // TODO
        break;
    case value2:
        // TODO
        break;
    case value3:
        // TODO
        break;
    default:
        // TODO
}
```

# 3 Loop Structures

## 3.1 `while` Loop

The `while` loop is the most basic loop. Its structure is:

```java
while(boolean) {
    // TODO;
}
```

*   As long as the boolean expression is `true`, the loop will continue to execute.
*   In most cases, we want the loop to stop, so we need a way to invalidate the expression to end the loop.
*   A few loops need to execute indefinitely, such as server request listeners.
*   If the loop condition remains `true` forever, it creates an infinite loop. In normal business programming, we should try to avoid infinite loops as they can affect performance or cause program crashes.

**Example Code:**

```java
package JavaLCKZ;

public class Demo03 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while(i <= 100){
            sum += i++;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

## 3.2 `do-while` Loop

For the `while` statement, if the condition is not met, the loop cannot be entered even once. However, sometimes we need the code to execute at least once even if the condition is not met.

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, with the difference being that the `do-while` loop will execute at least once.

```java
do {
    // TODO
} while(boolean);
```

*   `while` checks then executes; `do-while` executes then checks.
*   `do-while` guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once, which is its main difference from `while`.

**Example Code:**

```java
package JavaLCKZ;

public class Demo03 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        do {
            sum += i++;
        } while (i <= 100);
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

## 3.3 `for` Loop

Although all loop structures can be expressed with `while` or `do-while`, Java provides another statement—the `for` loop—to make some loop structures simpler.

The `for` loop statement is a general structure supporting iteration and is the most effective and flexible loop structure.

The number of times a `for` loop executes is determined before execution begins.

```java
for(initialization; boolean_description; update) {
    // TODO
}
```

**Example Code:**

```java
package JavaLCKZ;

public class Demo03 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0 ; i <= 100 ; i++){
            sum += i;
        }
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

**Enhanced `for` loop (Java 5+) for iterating over arrays and collections:**

```java
for(Declaration : Expression){
    // TODO
}
```

- **Declaration**: Declares a new local variable whose type must match the type of the array elements. Its scope is limited to the loop block, and its value is equal to the current array element.
- **Expression**: The expression is the name of the array to be accessed or a method that returns an array.

**Example Code:**

```java
package JavaLCKZ;

public class Demo03 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        for (int x : numbers){
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
```

## 3.4 `break` and `continue`

- `break` can be used in the body of any loop statement to control the flow of the loop. `break` is used to forcibly exit the loop, skipping any remaining statements in the loop.
- `continue` statements are used in the loop body to terminate the *current* iteration of the loop, skipping the statements in the loop body that have not yet been executed, and proceeding to the next iteration check.
